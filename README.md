# NodeJS Software Developer

## Problem

Create a login page that requires a username and password for authentication. You’ll need to design and implement a secure database structure to store the user credentials. After the user successfully logs in, display a dashboard where the data from the World Bank’s Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) API for Peru (https://api.worldbank.org/pip/v1/pip?country=PER) is visualized using a graph. The graph should dynamically update based on the data fetched from the API

## Technologies to use
